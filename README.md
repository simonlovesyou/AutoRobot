# AutoRobot

AutoRobot is an open-source macro-creation and automation application for Mac/Windows, inspired by [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com) and powered by Node.js/Javascript and [Electron shell](http://electron.atom.io).

## What's possible with AutoRobot?

- Automate basically everything by sending keystrokes and mouse clicks.
- Remap keys and buttons on your keyboard.
- Create hotkeys for your keyboard.
- Expand abbreviations inline, as you type them.
- Retrieve and change clipboard contents
- Power your script with npm packages

## Basic usage

### Hotkeys

Hotkeys are defined with the function `hotkey` that accepts a string and a callback. In the provided example below we will launch Spotify when the keys Command, Alt and 1 are pressed simultaneously and respectively quit Spotify with Command, Alt and 2.

```javascript
import hotkey from 'hotkey';
import launch from 'launch';
let spotify;

hotkey('Cmd+Alt+1', err => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  spotify = launch('/Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/MacOS/Spotify', {
    detached: true
  });
});

hotkey('Cmd+Alt+2', err => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  spotify.kill();
});
```

### Hotstrings

Hotstrings are defined with the function `Hotstring` which accepts two strings for its parameters. In the provided example below we will type out the current date when the user writes `'ddate'`

```javascript
Hotstring('ddate', new Date().toString());
```

The `ddate` will be erased by default, which can be overridden. Please see the full API for additional information.

### Applescript

AutoRobot can execute arbitrary AppleScript. In the following example we will ask iTunes to get the name of the current selection.

```javascript
import applescript from 'applescript';
import hotkey from 'hotkey';

const script = 'tell application "iTunes" to get name of selection';

hotkey('Alt+MediaPlayPause', err => {
  applescript.execString(script, function(err, res) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
    res.forEach(songName => {
      console.log(songName);
    });
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Scripts

Each script is a plain .txt or .js file with Javascript. A plain Javascript file will run upon execution, but some blocks may be defined to run only when some event occurs, such as a keystroke or hotkeypress.

Before executing the scripts they're evaluated with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS). If the scripts pass the evaluation they will be parsed to ES5 Javascript (Which means you can write Javascript/Node.js with ES6+) and they're executed with the use of [safe-eval](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-eval). Any syntax error found before execution must be fixed before the script can run.

## Build

To help contribute or test AutoRobot, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/simonlovesyou/AutoRobot.git
cd autorobot
npm i
mkdir tempScript # This is a temporary folder for adding userscripts. Will be removed in final build and when a GUI has been created.
touch tempScript/index.js # This is the expected name for the user script
npm run build # Alt. npm run dev
npm start
```
